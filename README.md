# Software-Professional-Salaries
Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a salary dataset using various data visualization libraries. The dataset includes information about job ratings, company names, job titles, salaries, locations, employment statuses, and job roles.
Code Description

The code is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Numpy: For numerical operations.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating data visualizations.
    Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects: For interactive plots.
    Pillow (PIL): For displaying images.
    Wordcloud: For generating word clouds.
    IPython.display: For displaying images in the Jupyter Notebook.

Data Loading

The code starts by loading the dataset from a CSV file named "Salary_Dataset_with_Extra_Features.csv.zip". It uses the Pandas library to read the data and displays the first few rows of the dataset to give an overview of the data's structure.
Data Exploration

The code performs various data exploration tasks, including:

    Displaying dataset shape (number of rows and columns).
    Listing the column names.
    Providing information about the data types and memory usage.
    Describing the basic statistics of numeric columns.
    Checking for missing values and duplicated rows.
    Displaying unique values in specific columns.

Data Visualization

The code creates various data visualizations to gain insights into the dataset, including:
Salary Distribution

    Displaying the mean, median, highest, and lowest salaries.
    Showing the top 5 lowest and highest salaries.

Location Analysis

    Visualizing the count of job salaries reported in different locations.
    Displaying the distribution of salaries by location.

Job Title Analysis

    Visualizing the count of job titles.
    Displaying a pie chart of the top 20 job titles.

Company Name Analysis

    Visualizing the count of company names.
    Displaying a word cloud of company names for a visual representation.

Employment Status Analysis

    Visualizing the distribution of employment statuses and their associated salaries.

Job Roles Analysis

    Visualizing the count of job roles.
    Displaying the distribution of salaries by job roles.
    Creating a pie chart to show the distribution of job roles.

Running the Code

    Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip.
    Download the dataset file "Salary_Dataset_with_Extra_Features.csv.zip" and place it in the appropriate directory.
    Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE to perform the data analysis and generate visualizations.

Please note that this readme provides an overview of the code and its purpose. For detailed analysis and insights, refer to the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
